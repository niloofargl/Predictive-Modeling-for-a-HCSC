You can access the code in the "Final Code" section. To run the code, please follow these steps:

    Download the entire folder.
    Open the "Train" document and click on the "Run" button.
    The output will pertain to the "Edmonton" area, but you can modify the "filepath" to change the region.
    The current values for "max_iter" and "pop_size" may need to be increased. The existing values in the code are not sufficient.
    The "start_day" and "n_days" parameters determine the first and last data points used during training.
